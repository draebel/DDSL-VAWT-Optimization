# DDSL-VAWT-Optimization

## makelist.sh (bash)
This gets the `.dat` files from the cleaned data 1636 airfoils associated with [DDSL experiment 1](https://github.com/maxjiang93/DDSL/tree/pub/experiments/exp1_airfoil).
```
 ./makelist.sh <full_path_to_input_data_folder> <full_path_to_output_folder>
 ```
This will create a `DatFiles` directory and an `AirfoilList.txt` file in the output folder.

## CPProcessor.m (Matlab R2018b)
This uses a spline function to interpolate a desired number of control points from an existing airfoil `.dat` file.

Place this file into the `DatFiles` directory and run. When completed, the control point files will be located in the `Control Point Files` directory.

## CaseWriter.py (Python 3)
This randomly chooses (with replacement) 1000 cases from the list of airfoils generated by `makelist.sh`. It reports `Airfoil,TSR (Tip Speed Ratio),AoA (Angle of Attack),AngularSpeed` of each case in CSV format. Must be in same directory as `AirfoilList.txt`. 

## process_airfoil_shapes_from_csv.py (Python 3)
This file must be run in the directory associated with [DDSL experiment 1](https://github.com/maxjiang93/DDSL/tree/pub/experiments/exp1_airfoil). Move this file and `CaseList.txt` generated from `CaseWriter.py` and run. This script will create polygon files from the airfoil necessary for training the neural network.

## FakeDataWriter.py (Python 3)
This file was used to test the neural network inputs and outputs and ensure that the correct steps were being done with the training process. If successful, the neural network will produce a result that is incorrect in its accuracy but correct in its format, showing that the neural network can be trained with proper data without error.
