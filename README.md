# DDSL-VAWT-Optimization

## makelist.sh (bash)
This gets the `.dat` files from the cleaned data 1636 airfoils associated with [DDSL experiment 1](https://github.com/maxjiang93/DDSL/tree/pub/experiments/exp1_airfoil).
```
 ./makelist.sh <full_path_to_input_data_folder> <full_path_to_output_folder>
 ```

## CPFinder.m (Matlab R2018b)
This uses a spline function to interpolate a desired number of control points from an existing airfoil `.dat` file.

TODO: we will run this on each airfoil's `.dat` file. Note that it has to be run in the same directory as the airfoil `.dat` file.

## CaseWriter.py (Python 3)
This randomly chooses (with replacement) 1000 cases from the list of airfoils generated by `makelist.sh`. It reports `Airfoil,Tip Speed Ratio (TSR),Angle of Attack (theta_0),Angular Speed (w)` of each case in CSV format. Must be in same directory as `AirfoilList.txt`.
